# OpenCodeReview Architecture

This document provides an overview of the OpenCodeReview system architecture, explaining how the different components interact to provide AI-powered code reviews.

## System Overview

OpenCodeReview is built using a microservices architecture, with each service responsible for a specific aspect of the code review process. This design allows for:

- **Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently based on demand
- **Resilience**: Failure in one service doesn't bring down the entire system
- **Flexibility**: Services can be developed, deployed, and updated independently
- **Technology diversity**: Different services can use different technologies as appropriate

## Core Components

### 1. API Gateway

The API Gateway serves as the entry point for all external requests, handling authentication, request routing, and rate limiting.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Authentication and authorization
- Request routing to appropriate services
- Rate limiting and throttling
- API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)

**Technologies:**
- FastAPI
- JWT for authentication
- Redis for rate limiting

### 2. Git Integration Service

This service handles communication with Git platforms (GitHub, GitLab, etc.), processing webhooks, and interacting with their APIs.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Webhook processing for pull request events
- Fetching code changes and repository information
- Posting review comments back to pull requests
- Managing authentication with Git platforms

**Technologies:**
- Python
- Platform-specific SDKs (PyGithub, python-gitlab, etc.)

- Scheduling system

### 9. Issue Tracking Integration

The Issue Tracking Integration connects with issue tracking systems to create and manage issues.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Creating issues from review comments
- Linking issues to code changes
- Updating issue status
- Enabling chat in issue comments

**Technologies:**
- Issue tracking system APIs
- Webhook processing

## Data Flow

### Pull Request Review Flow

1. A pull request is created or updated on a Git platform
2. The Git platform sends a webhook to the API Gateway
3. The API Gateway routes the webhook to the Git Integration Service
4. The Git Integration Service fetches the code changes
5. The Code Analysis Engine analyzes the changes
6. The AI Review Service generates review comments
7. The Git Integration Service posts the comments back to the pull request

### Chat Interaction Flow

1. A user comments on a review with a question or request
2. The Git platform sends a webhook to the API Gateway
3. The API Gateway routes the webhook to the Git Integration Service
4. The Git Integration Service processes the comment
5. The Chat Service generates a response
6. The Git Integration Service posts the response as a comment

## Deployment Architecture

OpenCodeReview can be deployed in various environments:

### Docker Compose

For small teams or testing, all services can be deployed using Docker Compose on a single machine.

### Kubernetes

For production environments, services can be deployed as Kubernetes pods, with horizontal scaling for high-demand services.

### Self-Hosted

For organizations with specific security requirements, OpenCodeReview can be deployed in an air-gapped environment with no external dependencies.

## Security Considerations

- **Data Privacy**: Code is processed in memory and not stored permanently
- **Authentication**: Secure authentication with Git platforms using OAuth or App tokens
- **Authorization**: Fine-grained access control for users and repositories
- **Secrets Management**: Secure storage of API keys and tokens
- **Network Security**: Encrypted communication between services

## Scalability

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Services can be scaled independently based on demand
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Message queue for handling high volumes of requests
- **Caching**: Caching of frequently accessed data to reduce load
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient use of resources through containerization

## Monitoring and Observability

- **Logging**: Structured logging for all services
- **Metrics**: Prometheus metrics for monitoring system health
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing for request flows
- **Alerting**: Alerting for critical issues

## Future Enhancements

- **Multi-Model Support**: Support for multiple LLM providers and models
- **Custom Analyzers**: Ability to add custom code analyzers
- **Advanced Learning**: More sophisticated learning from user feedback
- **Team Collaboration**: Enhanced features for team collaboration
- **CI/CD Integration**: Deeper integration with CI/CD pipelines
